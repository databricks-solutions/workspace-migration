# Workspace Migration

A Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB) that migrates Unity Catalog and legacy Hive
Metastore objects between Databricks workspaces — useful for control-plane
migrations, account consolidations, or moving between Azure regions.

## Coverage

> **See [docs/user_guide.md](docs/user_guide.md) for the full guide** — the
> phased migration approach, per-data-type strategy, setup, execution, and the
> Terraform-exporter path for assets the tool doesn't move directly. The
> summary below is the quick reference.

**Unity Catalog** (core jobs `migrate_uc` + `migrate_governance`)
- Catalogs, schemas, grants
- Managed tables (Delta; Iceberg via opt-in DDL replay), external tables
- Views, SQL and Python functions
- Volumes (managed with file-level copy, external via metadata replay)
- Tags, row filters, column masks, ABAC policies
- Lakehouse monitors, registered models (metadata + version artifacts + aliases)
- Connections, foreign catalogs
- Delta Sharing (shares, recipients, providers; objects include tables,
  views, volumes, schemas, catalogs)

**Legacy Hive Metastore** (standalone `migrate_hive` job, run only when needed)
- Databases, managed + external tables, views, functions, grants
- Migrated **like-for-like** into the target workspace's own `hive_metastore`
  (same database/table names, same storage) — not upgraded into a UC catalog.
  DBFS-root managed tables move via a two-hop shared staging path into the
  target's own DBFS root (gated on `migrate_hive_dbfs_root`)

**Stateful services** (optional standalone jobs — run as needed)
- **Vector Search** (`migrate_vector_search`) — Delta Sync indexes recreated +
  re-embedded; Direct Access indexes skipped
- **Online Tables** (`migrate_online_tables`) — converted to a Lakebase synced
  table (legacy online tables are deprecated); provisions a paid Lakebase instance
- **Lakeflow Connect** (`migrate_lfc`) — query-based + SaaS row_filter (clone
  history + row_filter boundary + unified view) and CDC/gateway (recreate,
  create-only); cross-workspace LFC is a cut-over, not in-place

**Not migrated by this tool** (see the user guide for the path)
- **Materialized views & streaming tables** — hard-skipped
  (`skipped_by_stateful_service_migration`); schema + grants still migrate,
  rebuild the object via a pipeline refresh at cutover
- **DLT pipelines, Model Serving endpoints, Apps** — migrated via the
  **Terraform exporter** (+ this tool's model migration for serving); see
  [docs/reference/dlt_pipeline_migration.md](docs/reference/dlt_pipeline_migration.md) and
  [docs/reference/model_serving_and_apps_migration.md](docs/reference/model_serving_and_apps_migration.md)

## Usage

Only `config.example.yaml` ships in the repo. `config.yaml` is **git-ignored**
so the source tree never carries environment-specific identifiers (workspace
URLs, SPN client id). Operators **copy the example and fill in real values**:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml   # then edit config.yaml with real values
```

`databricks bundle deploy` syncs your local `config.yaml` to the workspace at
`${workspace.file_path}/config.yaml` (DAB syncs working-tree files, so the
git-ignored config still deploys).

> **Don't edit the workspace copy directly.** The workspace copy is a
> mirror of your local copy — any workspace-side edit will be
> overwritten by the next `bundle deploy`. Edit locally and redeploy.

### Required deploy-time variables

`databricks.yml` declares two variables with no baked-in defaults —
operators must supply them for every deploy:

| Variable | Purpose | How to set |
|---|---|---|
| `migration_spn_id` | SPN application ID that jobs run as | `--var migration_spn_id=<app-id>` or env `BUNDLE_VAR_migration_spn_id` |
| `dashboard_warehouse_name` | Name of the SQL warehouse the dashboard reads from (resolved to an ID via lookup). Defaults to `cp-migration` — override if your warehouse has a different name | `--var dashboard_warehouse_name=<name>` or env `BUNDLE_VAR_dashboard_warehouse_name` |

The SPN needs: workspace admin on source + target, metastore-level
`CREATE_*` privileges, and `USE_PROVIDER` on target. For the Hive path it
also needs legacy `hive_metastore` `CREATE` on target (create databases +
tables), target DBFS root enabled + write access, and read/write on the
shared `hive_dbfs_staging_path` container — see the Hive section in
[docs/user_guide.md](docs/user_guide.md) for the full list.

#### Terraform / CLI compatibility note

The Databricks CLI ships a bundled Terraform binary whose OpenPGP signing
key has expired, causing `bundle deploy` to fail with
`error downloading Terraform: unable to verify checksums signature: openpgp: key expired`.
Work around by pointing the CLI at a locally-installed Terraform:

```
export DATABRICKS_TF_VERSION=1.5.7          # or your installed version
export DATABRICKS_TF_EXEC_PATH=/path/to/terraform
databricks bundle deploy -t dev
```

### Config reference (`config.yaml`)

| Field | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `source_workspace_url` | yes | — | Source workspace HTTPS URL |
| `target_workspace_url` | yes | — | Target workspace HTTPS URL |
| `spn_client_id` | yes | — | OAuth SPN application ID (jobs run as this) |
| `spn_secret_scope` | yes | — | Databricks secret scope holding the SPN secret |
| `spn_secret_key` | yes | — | Key within the secret scope |
| `catalog_filter` | no | `[]` (all) | Restrict discovery + migration to named catalogs. List or comma-separated string. |
| `schema_filter` | no | `[]` (all) | Restrict to named schemas within each catalog |
| `tracking_catalog` | no | `migration_tracking` | Catalog holding `discovery_inventory` / `migration_status` / `pre_check_results` |
| `tracking_schema` | no | `cp_migration` | Schema under `tracking_catalog` for the tracking tables |
| `dry_run` | no | `false` | Emit `skipped`/`dry_run` status rows; run no DDL against target |
| `batch_size` | no | `50` | Max objects per batched for-each task (keeps payload under the 3000-byte Databricks Jobs limit) |
| `iceberg_strategy` | no | `""` | `""` skips Iceberg managed tables (marking `skipped_by_config`). `"ddl_replay"` opts into the Option A path — rebuild schema + re-ingest via `cp_migration_share`. Loses snapshot history / time travel / branches + tags. |
| `rls_cm_strategy` | no | `""` | Managed tables carrying legacy row filter / column mask. `""` skips them (marking `skipped_by_rls_cm_policy`). `"staging_copy"` CTAS-copies each affected table into `<tracking_catalog>.cp_migration_staging`, shares the staging copy, DEEP CLONEs on target, then drops the staging copy. Source RLS/CM is never mutated. Requires the migration SPN to be a workspace admin and every active filter/mask to contain an admin-bypass call (`pre_check` enforces both). |
| `on_target_collision` | no | `"fail"` | What to do when a discovered source object has the same FQN as an object already on target AND no `migration_status` row says the tool created it. `"fail"` (default) — pre_check emits a FAIL `check_target_collisions` row and the migrate workflow refuses to start; operator must rename / drop the colliding object and rerun pre_check. `"skip"` — pre_check emits a WARN row and seeds `skipped_target_exists` migration_status rows; workers skip those objects on the next migrate run (target copy left untouched). See [docs/reference/idempotency_audit.md](docs/reference/idempotency_audit.md#collision-handling-x4). |
| `migrate_hive_dbfs_root` | no | `false` | Enables `hive_managed_dbfs_worker` — two-hop staging copy of a DBFS-root managed table into the target's own DBFS root (stays **managed** in `hive_metastore`, like-for-like) |
| `hive_dbfs_staging_path` | conditional | `""` | Shared `abfss://` staging path both workspaces can reach, used by the DBFS-root two-hop copy. Required when `migrate_hive_dbfs_root=true`. The SPN needs read/write on the container; the target also needs DBFS root enabled. (The deprecated `hive_dbfs_target_path` is still accepted as an alias with a warning.) |
| `overwrite_existing` | no | `false` | When `true`, workers replace an existing target object instead of skipping it. Leave `false` for the safe idempotent default (paired with `on_target_collision`). |
| `transfer_ownership` | no | `true` | When `true`, grants workers transfer object ownership to match source. Set `false` to leave target ownership as-created. |

### Deploy + configure flow

1. Clone this repo
2. `cp config.example.yaml config.yaml` and fill in real values (the file is
   git-ignored, so your real values never get committed):
   - `source_workspace_url` / `target_workspace_url`
   - `spn_client_id` + `spn_secret_scope`/`spn_secret_key` (OAuth service
     principal with access to both workspaces)
   - optional: `catalog_filter`, `schema_filter`, `iceberg_strategy`,
     `migrate_hive_dbfs_root`, `hive_dbfs_staging_path`,
     `overwrite_existing` (default false), `transfer_ownership` (default true)
3. `databricks bundle deploy -t dev --var migration_spn_id=<your-app-id>`
   (optionally `--var migration_admin_group=<your-admin-group>` to scope job
   management to a dedicated group instead of the default `admins`). This
   syncs your local `config.yaml` to the workspace along with the workflow
   definitions.
4. Run the `pre_check` workflow to validate connectivity and grants
5. Run `discovery` to inventory source objects
6. Re-run `pre_check` — the second run detects **target collisions**:
   source objects whose FQN already exists on target and isn't tracked
   by the tool. By default (`on_target_collision: fail`) this blocks
   step 7. Either rename / drop the colliding target objects, or flip
   `on_target_collision: skip` to proceed and leave them untouched.
7. Run the `migrate_*` jobs to replay on target — see the
   [Operator flow](#operator-flow) section below for the 4-job model
   and ordering.

To change values later, edit your local `config.yaml` and redeploy —
**don't edit the workspace copy** (it's a mirror and gets overwritten).

### Operator flow

The tool ships **three core jobs** (plus `discovery` and `pre_check`) and
**three optional stateful-service jobs**. Run the core sequence first:

1. **`discovery`** — scans the source workspace and writes
   `discovery_inventory`. The `migrate_*` jobs depend on it
   operationally; run discovery first.
2. **`migrate_uc`** — UC data plane migration: managed/external tables,
   views, functions, volumes, models, plus UC grants. Runs
   `setup_sharing` → `orchestrator` → workers → `cleanup_staging` →
   `summary_uc`. (Materialized views / streaming tables are hard-skipped
   here — see Coverage.)
3. **`migrate_hive`** — Hive (legacy) data plane migration:
   external/managed tables, functions, views, plus Hive ACLs replayed
   as UC grants on the target catalog.
4. **`migrate_governance`** — fine-grained governance: tags, comments,
   row filters, column masks, customer-defined shares, policies,
   monitors, foreign catalogs, connections.

Then, as needed, the **optional stateful-service jobs**:
`migrate_vector_search`, `migrate_online_tables`, `migrate_lfc` (see
Coverage and the [user guide](docs/user_guide.md), Steps 7–9).

Each `migrate_*` job is independent and standalone-runnable. They
assume `discovery_inventory` has been populated by an earlier
`discovery` run.

#### Standalone-runnable contract

`migrate_governance` runs standalone (per design Q1 in
[docs/reference/workflow_split_design.md](docs/reference/workflow_split_design.md)). It
assumes target catalog/schema/table/view/volume objects already exist
on target. **Do NOT** run `migrate_governance` against an empty
target — it will write governance state for objects that don't exist.

The `migrate_governance` job's first task `pre_check_governance`
validates only that `discovery_inventory` has governance rows. It
does **not** validate target objects.

#### Pre-conditions

For Path A `staging_copy` strategy (recommended for RLS/CM tables),
see the [Row filter / column mask on managed tables](#row-filter--column-mask-on-managed-tables)
section below.

### Running the integration tests

The integration workflows override the workspace `config.yaml` per-run
(backup before, restore in teardown), so you only need to populate the
environment-specific fields **once** after deploy.

1. `databricks bundle deploy -t dev --var migration_spn_id=<your-app-id>`
2. Edit `${workspace.file_path}/config.yaml` with the environment-specific
   fields once:
   - Real workspace URLs, SPN app ID, secret scope/key
   - `hive_dbfs_staging_path: abfss://<container>@<account>.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>`
     (a shared staging container both workspaces can reach; the SPN needs
     read/write on it, and the target workspace needs DBFS root enabled)
3. Trigger `uc_integration_test` — the first task (`setup_test_config`)
   rewrites the workspace config.yaml with UC-appropriate behavioural
   settings (`iceberg_strategy=ddl_replay`), runs
   seed → pre_check → discovery → `migrate_uc` → test, and
   `teardown_uc` restores the original config.yaml from the backup.
4. Trigger `hive_integration_test` — same pattern, with Hive-appropriate
   settings (`migrate_hive_dbfs_root=true`, `iceberg_strategy=""`),
   running seed → pre_check → discovery → `migrate_hive` → test. Your
   operator-set `hive_dbfs_staging_path` from step 2 is preserved —
   workflows don't overwrite env-specific paths, only the behavioural
   settings.
5. Trigger `governance_integration_test` — exercises the standalone
   `migrate_governance` job against fixtures pre-seeded on target.

The per-workflow settings live in each workflow's YAML task parameters;
edit them there if you need to change test behavior.

See [docs/reference/external_hive_metastore.md](docs/reference/external_hive_metastore.md) for
the Hive-specific cluster/init-script reconfiguration checklist.

## Delta Sharing prerequisites

Unity Catalog's Delta Sharing APIs (`shares.list()`, `recipients.list()`,
and `shares.get(..., include_shared_data=True)`) only return objects
where the caller is the **owner** or holds `USE SHARE` / `USE RECIPIENT`.
Objects the caller can't see are silently skipped by the API — no
exception is raised.

The migration SPN connects to both workspaces via OAuth M2M (see
`spn_client_id` in config). For Delta Sharing discovery to find your
customer-defined shares and recipients, the SPN must either:

1. **Own** each share + recipient to be migrated (recommended), or
2. Hold `USE SHARE` on each share and `USE RECIPIENT` on each recipient.

Both can be granted via SQL on the source workspace before running
`discovery`:

```sql
-- Transfer ownership (strongest, implies USE SHARE / USE RECIPIENT):
ALTER SHARE `my_customer_share` OWNER TO `<spn-application-id>`;
ALTER RECIPIENT `my_customer_recipient` OWNER TO `<spn-application-id>`;

-- Or grant the minimum required privileges:
GRANT USE SHARE ON SHARE `my_customer_share` TO `<spn-application-id>`;
GRANT USE RECIPIENT ON RECIPIENT `my_customer_recipient` TO `<spn-application-id>`;
```

If this step is skipped, `discovery` silently omits the share / recipient
from `discovery_inventory`, no migration_status row is written, and the
object won't be recreated on target. `pre_check`'s `check_source_sharing`
only verifies that the SPN can call `shares.list()` at all — not that
any specific customer share is visible.

The migration tool's own internal `cp_migration_share` is created by
`setup_sharing` under the SPN's own identity, so it's always owned by
the SPN and never affected by this.

## Row filter / column mask on managed tables

Delta Sharing providers cannot share tables protected by legacy
row-level security or column masks — i.e. anything applied via
`ALTER TABLE ... SET ROW FILTER` or `ALTER COLUMN ... SET MASK`. The
Delta Sharing API rejects such tables with:

```
InvalidParameterValue: Table <fqn> has row level security or column masks,
which is not supported by Delta Sharing.
```

Because this tool uses Delta Sharing to move managed-table data between
workspaces, affected tables can't flow through the standard path.

### Default behavior (safe skip)

With `rls_cm_strategy: ""` (the default), discovery surfaces a warning
listing the affected tables, and `setup_sharing` excludes them from the
share. `migration_status` records one row per skipped table with
`status = skipped_by_rls_cm_policy` so the skip is auditable from the
dashboard and the test suite. **The skipped tables' data does not move
to target.** Schema and grants on those tables still migrate, but the
table itself arrives on target empty (or doesn't arrive at all,
depending on whether a prior migration created it).

### Your options

1. **Migrate governance to ABAC first.** Delta Sharing *does* support
   sharing tables protected by Unity Catalog ABAC row filter and column
   mask policies (the caller must be exempt from the policy). Rewrite
   the affected tables' RLS/CM as ABAC policies on source before
   running this tool. Recipients can also apply their own ABAC-based
   RLS/CM on the shared tables on target.

2. **Accept the skip** and re-populate the affected tables by other
   means after the migration (e.g. point queries at source during
   cutover, or rebuild from upstream).

3. **Opt into `rls_cm_strategy: staging_copy`** (Path A). For each
   affected table, the tool creates a staging copy in
   `<tracking_catalog>.cp_migration_staging.stg_<sha12>` via
   `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ... AS SELECT * FROM <original>`, adds the
   staging FQN to `cp_migration_share`, and `managed_table_worker`
   DEEP CLONEs the staging table on target. Source RLS/CM is **never**
   mutated — there is no maintenance window in which the source is
   unprotected. After `migrate_uc` completes, the `cleanup_staging`
   task (gated on `run_if: ALL_DONE` inside `migrate_uc_workflow.yml`)
   drops the staging tables. The filter / mask itself is reapplied on
   target by `migrate_governance` (`row_filters_worker` /
   `column_masks_worker`) reading from `discovery_inventory`.

   **Pre-conditions** (both enforced by `pre_check`):

   - The migration SPN **must be a workspace admin** on the source
     workspace. The CTAS into staging reads through the source's row
     filter; without admin status, the SPN gets filtered data and the
     staging copy is incomplete.
   - **Every active row filter / column mask function body must
     contain an admin-bypass call** — one of `is_account_group_member(`,
     `is_member(`, or `is_user_in_group(`. Without this, even an admin
     SPN's CTAS returns filtered data.

   `pre_check` validates both invariants before any side-effecting
   work. If either fails, `staging_copy` is rejected and the operator
   must either grant admin status / add the bypass clause, or fall
   back to skip / ABAC.

## Architecture

- All workflows run on serverless compute
- Delta Sharing is used to move managed-table bytes between workspaces
  (`DEEP CLONE` from a share-consumer catalog on target)
- Three Delta tracking tables in `migration_tracking.cp_migration`:
  `discovery_inventory`, `migration_status`, `pre_check_results`
- A Lakeview dashboard surfaces counts, failures, and durations per
  object type
